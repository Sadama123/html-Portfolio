<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>      Hi, I’m Joepeth Matining an aspiring new programmer and still learning the nooks and cranny about programming. I’m still trying new things and exploring new ways to improve my knowledge about programming. </p>

<p>      I’m an IT graduate and a computer gamer that’s why I choose to became a programmer, to learn how to make the games and website that I usually use in my everyday life.</p>

<p>While learning programming it gives me more respect and appreciation to the programmers that works day and night to make a complicated things to simple way possible for the end users..</p>
